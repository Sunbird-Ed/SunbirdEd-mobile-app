# IOS Development setup
## Prerequisites
    1. Node js version 10.18.1
    2. Ionic 5.4.16 using `npm i ionic@5.4.16 -g`
    3. Cordova 9.0.0  using `npm i cordova@9.0.0 -g`
    4. cordova-res 0.15.3 - using `npm install -g cordova-res`
    5. ios-deploy  1.11.4 - using `brew install ios-deploy`
    all of the above should be installed globally
    Xcode 12.4 Build version 12D4e or above

    NOTE: For M1 chipset users please go through FAQ section for ROSETA 2 compatibility and usage.
    
## Steps
    1. Checkout sunbird-mobile-app repo from https://github.com/shikshalokam/SunbirdEd-mobile-app with branch release-3.9.0-ios
    2. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
    3. cd to <sunbird-mobile-app> local path
    4. Rename `sunbird.properties.example` file to `sunbird.properties` and put all the valid credentials and api endpoint.
    5. RUN ./build-ios.sh
    6. RUN cordova emulate ios
## FAQ
1. error: Value for SWIFT_VERSION cannot be empty. (in target 'Sunbird' from project 'Sunbird') or Duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist file error
  open platforms/ios/Sunbird.xcworkspace 
  Select Sunbird 
  Build setting Project, targets
  update Swift language version to 4 
  Inside Tagets -> Build phases -> Copy Bundle Resources -> remove duplicate GoogleService-Info.plist if present
  and close Xcode then rerun the **cordova emulate ios**
2. M1 Chipset users - Turn off ROSETA for XCODE 
  Open Applications -> Right Click Xcode -> Click on Get Info -> Unchek Open with Roseta
  Once `build-ios.sh` is completed, open platforms/ios/Sunbird.xcworkspace and run the application by clicking on Play button
3. Install Java on Mac
  Check if JAVA is already insalled or not by running following command in terminal
  `javac --version` if you get the verdetails then it's installed already
  Check the installation path in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`
  Check is JAVA_HOME is set by runnig `echo $JAVA_HOME`, if you get the installation path as output then JAVA_HOME is set
